# Keeper App 
Inspired by Google's Keep App, Keeper alines the possibility to store notes. Coding along with Angela Yu's Complete Web Development Bootcamp course on Udemy, I completed the first of many React Apps.

## Lessons Learned
Four days prior to finishing this project, I had never seen nor written React code. I found it fascinating and exciting to make websites more dynamic with React. It felt like bringing JavaScript code to life! Instead of multiple files for different pages or long JavaScript files, React splits the features of a website into components and utilizes useState() to make them store data and functional. I also had great opportunites for debugging. Finding minuscule typos had a great effect on the app, allowing the note to actually render on the page. Troubleshooting in the terminal for material ui icons to be downloaded as dependencies. I thought it was awesome to import the icons as components! Overall, this Keeper App was a great start on learning React.
